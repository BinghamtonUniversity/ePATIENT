# ePATIENT

ePATIENT is an educational EMR to aid in asynchronous interprofessional healthcare training. ePATIENT allows multiple student professions, from different campuses, to simultaneously access "virtual patient" records in real-time allowing them to respond to notes, orders, and comments from other members of the team as clinical professionals do in real-world clinical environments.
